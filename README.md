## Oh What... To Do?
### Overview
A tech test style brief given to us on week 8 of the _nology front-end coding bootcamp. A user would be able to create and manage their own todo lists, syncing across as many devices as necessary.

### The Brief
- Use React to create an application
- Host this application on firebase
- Use your custom domain name e.g todo.mydomain.com
- Users can log in using their gmail account
- You will need to unit test your components
- You have 3 hours

### Tech Used
- React
- Firebase (Hosting, Auth, Database)

### Current State
- User can add, edit, and delete tasks
- User can "complete" tasks
- User tasks are synced across any device they log in to via the Firebase Database
- Hosted with Firebase on todo.dforder.com

### How to
- Clone the repo
- ```yarn install```
- ```yarn start```
